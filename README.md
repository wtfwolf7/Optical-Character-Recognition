# Optical-Character-Recognition
We, humans, read text almost every minute of our life.  Wouldnâ€™t it be great if our machines or systems could also read the text just like the way we do?
This is where Optical Character Recognition (OCR) comes into the picture.
I've used TESSERACT OCR in this case.
